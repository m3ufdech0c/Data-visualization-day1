# Traveling Companions, 

Read into 3 different csv files.

Merge 2 of them and renamed the x and y duplicated columns accordingly.

Then merged the 3 one into the previously combined df.

Calculated the mean of the newly combined df.

Created a new df where the calculated mean above is > 1.

Set 3 variables for 3 countries (rows) to look at.

Using those variables in a df.loc () function to create a variable for a specific column of the df (the type of traveling companion to compare).

Plotted 3 lines in 1 graph. Created xticks using the list that was created for the x-axis values.
# Part 1

This is Part 1 of a three-part mini-project.

In this first part of the activity, you will take three separate CSVs that were gathered from Tourism Malaysia, merge them together, and then create charts to visualize a comparison of travelers to Malaysia from different countries of origin over three years.

## Instructions

* Check the comments in each cell of this [Jupyter Notebook file](Unsolved/traveling_companions.ipynb) for activity instructions.

* Your final table should align with the following table:

   ![Merged Table.](Images/08-TravelingCompanion_Output.png)


# Part 2 

This is Part 2 of a three-part mini-project.

In this second part, you will examine the averages of each column and reduce the DataFrame to include only types of companion travelers that are above 1% across all three years.

## Instructions

* Check the comments in each cell of this [Jupyter Notebook file](Unsolved/traveling_companions.ipynb) for activity instructions.

* Your final table should align with the following table:

   ![Companion Output.](Images/09-TravelingCompanion2_Output.png)


# Part 3

This is the third and final part of a three-part mini-project.

In this final part, you will take the DataFrame you created and, using Matplotlib, chart a comparison of three different countries for one type of traveling companion between 2016 and 2018.

## Instructions

* Check the comments in each cell of this [Jupyter Notebook file](Unsolved/traveling_companions.ipynb) for activity instructions.

* Your output should align with the following figure, depending on the user’s input variable:

   ![outcome.](Images/10-TravelCompanion_Output.png)

## Bonus

Try to modify the notebook file so that it will request user input for the 3 country variables and the traveling companion type.
